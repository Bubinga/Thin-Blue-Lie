        <strong>In Short: &nbsp;</strong>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain

    </p>
    <p>

        information you choose to make public on such social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the
        relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media
        provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your
        privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

        but are not affiliated with, our Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services or mobile
        applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this
        privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services
        or applications that may be linked to or from the Website. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your
        questions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
    <p>

        otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
        period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
        information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this
        is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
        be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
        defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
        transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
    </p>

        you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users
        less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If
        you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacy@thinbluelie.us.
    </p>

    <p><strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp; You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>

        to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:

    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at privacy@thinbluelie.us.</p>

        <strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to
        set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services
        of our Website. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Website visit

    <p>
        <strong>Opting out of email marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
        the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may
        still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond
        to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your account settings and update your preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to
        signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
        standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong>12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>

        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Website, you have the right to request removal of
        unwanted data that you publicly post on the Website. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below,

    <p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>
    <p>Verification process</p>
    <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.
        These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us.
        For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with
        the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
        We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
        If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
        purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish
        verifying you.

        <li>
            you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent
            that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
            you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act
